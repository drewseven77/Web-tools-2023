        <Section>
            <img src="images/robpic2.jpeg" alt="This is my image.">
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                A native of San Francisco, Rob Schneider was the youngest of five children and was brought up by his
                Filipino mother and Jewish father. He began writing jokes at age 15, in addition to appearing at local
                comedy club venues. He was inspired through the albums and films of Monty Python, Richard Pryor, Gene
                Wilder and Peter Sellers.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating from Pacifica's Terra Nova High School, he got his first break when he appeared on
                "Late Night with David Letterman." While trying to make a name for himself, he honed his act at San
                Francisco comedy clubs opening for the likes of Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld and Dana Carvey.
                In 1988, he married former model London King and although they had a daughter together, the marriage
                only lasted two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels spotted Rob on HBO's 13th Annual Young Comedians Special in
                1990 and signed him up as a writer on SNL. While on the show, he dated fellow actress/comedian Julia
                Sweeney.

            <h3>Feature films, sitcoms, and endorsements</h3>

            <p>
                Schneider was part of the comedy team at NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live (From 1990 to 1994
                at SNL), he played such roles as "Tiny Elvis", "Orgasm Guy", Richard Laymer, the office worker beside
                the photocopier, who addressed each of his fellow employees with an endless stream of annoying gossip.
                Schneider is featured in the video release The Bad Boys of Saturday Night Live, along with colleagues
                Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Chris Farley.After leaving SNL, Schneider played supporting
                roles in a series of movies including Surf Ninjas, Judge
                Dredd, The Beverly Hillbillies, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Demolition Man, and Down Periscope. He
                also appeared in a recurring part on the television series Coach. In 1996, he co-starred in the NBC
                sitcom Men Behaving Badly, an American take on the hit British series of the same name. The U.S. version
                ran for two seasons.
            </p>

            <p> Schneider starred in the 1999 feature 
                film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, a tale of a fish-tank cleaner who
                incurs a massive debt and is forced to become a "man-whore." This was followed by The Animal, about a
                man given animal powers by a mad scientist; The Hot Chick, wherein the body of a petty thief named Clive
                Maxtone (played by Schneider) is mystically switched with the body of a pretty, but mean-spirited high
                school cheerleader named Jessica Spencer (played by Rachel McAdams in her film debut); and the sequel
                Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. The latter movie was not well received by critics or moviegoers, and as
                a result, Schneider won a 2005 Worst Actor Razzie Award for his role in the film.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2006, Schneider co-starred in the baseball-themed family comedy The Benchwarmers, along with his
                fellow SNL alumnus David Spade as well as Jon Heder. Other film roles include Schneider's appearance
                with Jim Henson's Muppets in the 1999 film Muppets from Space, and his role as a San Francisco hobo in
                the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days.
            </p>

            <p>
                Schneider's directorial debut, the comedy Big Stan, was released in some overseas markets during the
                fall of 2008, with a U.S. release in early 2009. In the film, he starred as a real estate con artist who
                is arrested for perpetrating real-estate scams. He is sentenced to prison, so he takes a crash-course in
                martial arts to survive incarceration.</p>

            <p>
                Schneider has also appeared in numerous comedies starring his SNL comrade Adam Sandler, including 1998's
                The Waterboy, 2010's Grown Ups, and 2020's Hubie Halloween. The comedic characters Schneider plays in
                these films include an overly enthusiastic Cajun man who proclaims the catch-phrase, "You can do it!";
                an amiable Middle Eastern delivery boy; a prison inmate; and Sandler's one-eyed Hawaiian sidekick, Ula.
                Schneider has uttered the line "You can do it!" as a running gag in Sandler's films The Waterboy, Little
                Nicky, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, and Bedtime Stories, as well as in a deleted scene from Click
                (a sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song "Original Prankster" by The
                Offspring). Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider's The
                Animal. Schneider narrated Sandler's 2002 animated movie Eight Crazy Nights, and voiced the part of a
                Chinese waiter. Schneider also had an uncredited cameo as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister in
                the 2007 Sandler-Kevin James comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, and played a Palestinian cab
                driver who serves as the title character's nemesis in the 2008 Sandler film You Don't Mess with the
                Zohan.</p>

            <p>
                Schneider played a variety of roles in the 2005 television special Back to Norm, starring another former
                SNL player Norm Macdonald, and appeared on episodes of the popular television shows Seinfeld and Ally
                McBeal. Schneider hosted the Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit '97 TV special, and the 2005 Teen Choice
                Awards, and was a frequent guest on NBC's late-night variety program The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In
                Schneider's appearance with Leno on the July 24, 2007, episode of The Tonight Show, he showed up in drag
                as actress Lindsay Lohan after the latter cancelled following a controversial arrest for driving under
                the influence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Besides his efforts in movies and television, Schneider released his first comedy album Registered
                Offender in July 2010. Registered Offender is composed of audio sketches and songs, with Schneider
                himself doing all of the character voices on the recording. He also revived his stand-up comedy career
                in 2010 with an international tour of theaters, clubs, and casinos.
            </p>

            <p>
                Schneider appeared in the music video for country singer Neal McCoy's "Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On",
                as the song's title character. McCoy and Schneider met while the two went on a USO tour in support of
                U.S. troops two months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Schneider starred as the title character in the CBS sitcom Rob, which was loosely based on his real
                life. The series was canceled by CBS in May 2012. In 2015, he produced, directed and starred in Real
                Rob, a sitcom that follows his life and includes his real-life wife Patricia and daughter Miranda.
                Netflix released a season of 8 episodes, and a second season in 2017.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2021, Schneider competed on season six of The Masked Singer as the wild card contestant "Hamster". A
                running gag is that "Hamster" would pantomime urinating on Nick Cannon and get affectionate with him.
                When unmasked on the fifth week, Schneider dedicated his performance of Luis Miguel's Sabor a Mí to
                Patricia and his daughters Miranda, Madeline, and Elle. In addition, Schneider did a variation of his
                Townie character's "You can do it" line by quoting Hamster's final words "You can do it Masked Singer,
                all night long!"
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2022, he starred, produced, and directed in Daddy Daughter Trip, which served as his third film as a
                director and also starred his wife Patricia and daughter Miranda. The film was to be exclusively shown
                in Harkins Theaters.

            <h3>Political Views and Positions</h3>
            <p>
                Schneider has been a critic of childhood vaccinations. In an interview with News10 in Sacramento,
                Schneider opined that "The efficacy of these shots have not been proven ... And the toxicity of these
                things we're having more and more side effects. We're having more and more autism." Schneider's
                statements have been discredited as lacking any factual basis. He also views the actions from the
                state to mandate vaccinations as government overreach.
            </p>
<figure class="image2"><img src="images/robpicture6-small.jpg" alt="Rob Schneider"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
            <p class="aroundfig">
        
                In 2015, Schneider actively opposed the passage of two California laws, California Assembly Bill 2109
                and California Senate Bill 277, which both made childhood vaccination exemptions harder to obtain. On
                September 28, 2012, Schneider and California State Assemblyman Tim Donnelly spoke at the "Medical
                Freedom Rally", where they urged California Governor Jerry Brown to veto Assembly Bill 2109, which would
                have made it more difficult for parents to use philosophical reasons for exemptions from mandatory
                childhood vaccinations. While the bill was not vetoed, Governor Brown added a signing message
                instructing the Department of Health to add a religious exemption and to make sure the process was not
                overly burdensome to parents.
            </p>

            <p class="aroundfig">
                While fighting California Senate Bill 277, which removed exemptions to mandatory vaccinations due to
                personal beliefs, Schneider left a phone message to California state Assemblywoman and bill co-author
                Lorena Gonzalez saying that he would spend money against her in her next re-election. Gonzalez, in an
                interview with The Washington Times, said that she found the message to be disturbing, but upon calling
                back, she said, "he was actually much nicer to me, but let's be honest … that is 20 mins of my life I'll
                never get back arguing that vaccines don't cause autism with Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.
